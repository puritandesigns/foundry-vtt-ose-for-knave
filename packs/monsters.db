There are many subspecies of dragon, many of which are distinguished by the colour of their scales. All dragons are egg-layers and hoard treasure in their lairs, far from areas of human civilisation.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<ul>\n<li>Behaviour:&nbsp;Chaotic dragons usually try to eat humans, but may sometimes capture them. Neutral dragons may attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons may aid parties worthy of the honour.<\/li>\n<li>Pride:&nbsp;Dragons are immensely proud creatures and will always listen to flattery.<\/li>\n<li>Attack pattern:&nbsp;A dragon always attacks first with its breath weapon, then either breathes again or makes melee attacks (equal chance of either).<\/li>\n<li>Breath weapon:&nbsp;Can be used up to three times per day. All caught in the area suffer damage equal to the dragon&rsquo;s current hit points (save versus breath for half). Shapes of breath weapon:\n<ul>\n<li>Cloud:&nbsp;50\u2032 long, 40\u2032 wide, 20\u2032 high.<\/li>\n<li>Cone:&nbsp;2\u2032 wide at the mouth, 30\u2032 wide at far end.<\/li>\n<li>Line:&nbsp;5\u2032 wide along whole length.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Energy immunity:&nbsp;Unharmed by their own breath weapon or lesser versions thereof. Automatically save versus similar attack forms. (For example, a red dragon is immune to flaming oil and suffers half damage from fire ball spells.)<\/li>\n<li>Language and spells:&nbsp;Some dragons are able to speak (their own tongue plus Common). The chance is listed by subspecies. Those that can speak can also cast randomly selected magic-user spells (the listed number and level of spells).<\/li>\n<li>Sleeping:&nbsp;The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies. A sleeping dragon may be attacked for one round with a +2 bonus to hit.
